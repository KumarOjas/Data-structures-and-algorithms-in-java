/*Enumerations was added to Java language in JDK5. Enumeration means a list of named constant. In Java, enumeration defines a class type.
An Enumeration can have constructors, methods and instance variables. It is created using enum keyword. Each enumeration constant is 
public, static and final by default. Even though enumeration defines a class type and have constructors, you do not instantiate an enum
using new. Enumeration variables are used and declared in much a same way as you do a primitive variable.*/
/*Java.util.Vector Class in Java

The Vector class implements a grow
able array of objects. Vectors basically falls in legacy classes but now it is fully compatible with collections.

Vector implements a dynamic array that means it can grow or shrink as required. Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an
integer index
They are very similar to ArrayList but Vector is synchronised and have some legacy method which collection framework does not contain.
It extends AbstractList and implements List interfaces.
Constructor:

Vector(): Creates a default vector of initial capacity is 10.
Vector(int size): Creates a vector whose initial capacity is specified by size.
Vector(int size, int incr): Creates a vector whose initial capacity is specified by size and increment is specified by incr. It specifies the number
of elements to allocate each time that a vector is resized upward.
Vector(Collection c): Creates a vector that contains the elements of collection c.
